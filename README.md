A collection of my articles on governance, policy, and foreign affairs

Welcome to my collection of policy essays and analytical papers on governance, national security, and public affairs in Nigeria.  
These writings reflect my academic background and interest in **policy, governance, diplomacy, and strategic studies**.


## 🧩 1. Federal Character: The Real Lack of Character
**Summary:**  
This article critically examines the principle of **Federal Character** in Nigeria’s political system, questioning how inclusivity can thrive in a leadership culture that often lacks integrity.  
Although embedded in the **1999 Constitution (as amended)**, Federal Character is undermined by **tribalism and clannism**, weakening national cohesion.  
The paper highlights constitutional provisions and argues for adopting the Federal Character principle as a **national security policy** to promote peace and unity.



## 🧠 2. A Look at the Theory of the Social Contract, the Nigerian Government, and National Security
**Summary:**  
This essay revisits the **social contract theory** from philosophers such as **Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau** and connects it to Nigeria’s governance and security challenges.
